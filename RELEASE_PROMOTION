== Release Promotion ==

On release day:

- Check with if packages are ready, and enabled for synching to the public FTPs, this should happen about 6 - 8 hours in advance of the public announcement
- Prepare the websites:
    * add announcement to www/announcements/announce-x.x.x.php with "INCOMPLETE DRAFT ANNOUNCEMENT" warning if preparing in advance
    When most of the mirrors behind http://download.kde.org have updated:
    Commit announcement (after adding PHP header/footer)
    * have announcement text and Dot story reviewed on IRC
    * remove "Draft" warning on www/announcements/announce-x.x.x.php
    Add an entry to
    * www/index.php,
    * www/announcements/index.php,
    * www/info/releases.php,
    * www/download/index.php (only for stable releases + updates) and
    * www/info/x.x.x.php
- Update the contents of release_files in the define_release_data function of trunk/l10n-kde4/scripts/generate_release_data.py
  Remember the key of release_files has to match the $release variable of the announce-x.x.x.php file
