== Release Engineering ==

Choose version number: 
 * remember that RPM is stupid and considers 5.0beta1 newer than
   5.0, so always use "code versions" for the packages. Also
   stuff like "-" etc is not working, so omit it

Make sure that dependencies are met:
 * new phonon release needed?
 * new soprano release needed?
 * new akonadi release needed (check kdepimlibs/akonadi/session_p.h)

Ensure everything is green in build.kde.org
Ensure there are no unrelated local changes, then proceed with updating the version numbers:

For each release (i.e. x.y.z)
 * kdelibs/CMakeLists.txt - KDE_VERSION_*
 * kdelibs/README - This is version x.y.z of the KDE libraries.
 * kdelibs/cmake/modules/KDE4Defaults.cmake - GENERIC_LIB_VERSION and KDE_NON_GENERIC_LIB_VERSION
 * kdelibs/kdecore/sycoca/ksycoca.cpp --> KSYCOCA_VERSION
 * kdepimlibs/CMakeLists.txt - KDEPIMLIBS_VERSION_*
 * kde-workspace/CMakeLists.txt - KDE4WORKSPACE_VERSION_*
 * kdepim/CMakeLists.txt - KDEPIM_DEV_VERSION / KDEPIM_VERSION
 * kdepim-runtime/CMakeLists - KDEPIM_RUNTIME_DEV_VERSION and KDEPIM_RUNTIME_VERSION

For KDE Frameworks releases
 ./kdesrc-build --src-only
 rm -rf frameworks/kf5umbrella
 Update versions:
  * ./increase_frameworks_version.sh step1

 Then wait for a successful rebuild on build.kde.org, to avoid failing all the frameworks at the next commit

 Upgrade version requirements:
  * ./increase_frameworks_version.sh step2
