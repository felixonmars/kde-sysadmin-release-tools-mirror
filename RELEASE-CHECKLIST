Make the following directories:
clean sources dirty
and optionally:
test build done

Choose version number: 
 * remember that RPM is stupid and considers 5.0beta1 newer than
   5.0, so always use "code versions" for the packages. Also
   stuff like "-" etc is not working, so omit it

Update version number
 * */*.lsm
 * arts/configure.in.in
 * quanta/configure.in.in
 * kdevelop/configure.in.in
 * kdebase/konqueror/version.h
 * kdebase/startkde 
 * kde-common/admin/cvs.sh has VERSION="3.x"
 * kdelibs/kdecore/kdeversion.h
 * kdelibs/kdecore/ksycoca.h --> ksycoca version number
 * kdelibs/README
 * kdenetwork/kopete/kopete/main.cpp
 * bugs/template/wizard/report.html.tmpl
 * bugs/bugz/wizard_config.pl
 * for koffice: configure.in.in, lib/kofficecore/kofficeversion.h, etc.
 * pack script :)

Update kdepackages in kdelibs/kdeui
Make sure the meinproc in path is a version of the correct branch
Check out or update everything with the correct branch tag
Make sure all admin directories are up to date as well (and are not symlinks)
Copy the clean sources into "clean" directory (e.g. <releasedir>/clean/koffice)
For koffice: rename kde-i18n to koffice-i18n (the script takes care of removing all the non-koffice stuff)
Put list of languages into kde-i18n's subdirs, after backing up the existing one into subdirs.orig
Make sure the xx language isn't listed in "subdirs"
Run "removestuff <module>", which removes subdirs that shouldn't be tagged (pack does that)
   (currently used for kde-i18n, koffice and koffice-i18n only)
Tag the CVS
Make sure the admin directories gets tagged as well
Make tarballs using "pack <module>". Start with kde-i18n. Do kdelibs/kdebase last.
If you have to redo a tarball because of a code cahnge and don't want to wait for meinproc to complete,
extract the old tarball inside cache/ before calling "pack". The docu script will
then use the version from the cache instead of regenerating it, saving a lot of time.
(for koffice-i18n, use the root and admin dir from KDE_3_1_BRANCH)
Upload tarballs to their final location, as 'ftprelease' user under a src/ directory.
chmod o-rwx any new dir (so that they're not yet public)
chmod g+w the new directory where packagers will put their files
Test tarballs
md5sum *.tar.bz2 kde-i18n/*.tar.bz2 > MD5SUMS
gpg --detach-sign -a MD5SUMS (if you're bored, do it for all files)
Prepare a Changelog
Ask Binner for announcement (this used to be done on the kde-pr mailing-list)

When everything is ready:
Make directory on the FTP site readable, so that mirrors can start getting it
When most of the mirrors behind http://download.kde.org have updated:
Commit announcement (after adding PHP header/footer)
Add an entry to www/announcements/index.html
If you've got root@ktown, edit motd.rsync 
Post announcement in text to kde-announce@kde.org (with a @kde.org From address
  so that it doesn't need moderation).
Post news bit to
  * dot.kde.org (editors@kdenews.org)
  * freshmeat.net
  * newsgroups, optionally
