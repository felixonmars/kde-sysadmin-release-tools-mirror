Make the following directories:
clean sources dirty
and optionally:
test build done

Choose version number: 
 * remember that RPM is stupid and considers 5.0beta1 newer than
   5.0, so always use "code versions" for the packages. Also
   stuff like "-" etc is not working, so omit it

Update version number
 * */*.lsm
 * kdebase/konqueror/version.h
 * kdebase/startkde 
 * kde-common/admin/Makefile.common has VERSION="2.x"
 * kdesupport/configure.in
 * kde-i18n/configure.in
 * kdelibs/kdecore/kdeversion.h
 * kdelibs/kdecore/ksycoca.h --> ksycoca version number
 * kdelibs/README
 * for koffice: *_aboutdata.h, configure.in.in, koshell_main.cc ...
 * pack script :)

Check out or update everything with the correct branch tag
Make sure all admin directories are up to date as well
For koffice: rename kde-i18n as koffice-i18n (the script takes care of removing all the non-koffice stuff)
Put list of languages into kde-i18n's subdirs, after backing up the existing one into subdirs.orig
** remove the xx language! **
Tag the CVS
Make sure the admin directoies gets tagged as well
Make tarballs using pack (includes doc creation). Start with kde-i18n. Do kdelibs/kdebase last.
Upload tarballs on the packager account
chmod g+w the new directory in the packager account
Test tarballs
