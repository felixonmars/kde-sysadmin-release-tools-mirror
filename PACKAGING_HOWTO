This is a quick description on how KDE Frameworks packaging is done.

 * rm -rf sources versions REVISIONS_AND_HASHES l10n tags.git
 * Update version file with the correct version number
    (ask Alex Merry if in doubt about making a new ECM release, after git diff v1.last.0..)
 * Edit config, ensure dry_run=0
 * Update modules.svn file with the correct svn modules and branches
 * Update modules.git file with the correct git modules and branches
     (when releasing frameworks, run ./list_frameworks.sh)
 * Read UPDATING_VERSIONS
 * Pack the sources (from ssh -A scripty@l10n.kde.org)
     (when releasing frameworks: ./update_l10n.sh ; ./make_rc_tag.sh ; kdesrc-build frameworks)
     ./pack_all.sh

     Frameworks: to apply a hotfix:
        git checkout local_release ; git fetch ; git cherry-pick -x sha1 ; git tag -a vx.y.z-rcN -m "<message>" ; git push --tags
        Update N in tags.git, ./pack.sh <module>, create_sources_inc

 * If you have ssh access to ftpadmin@depot.kde.org, upload the tarballs there,
   directly into the right location (and use chmod o-rx on the directory).
   Otherwise read ftp://upload.kde.org/README for how to upload the tarballs
   in case of doubt sysadmin will kindly help you
   Note that usually the tarballs are first only available to distro packagers
   and later they are public to everyone. sysadmin knows how to do that.
 * Do not forget to tell whoever does the ftp work to update the latest symlink
 * Inform kde-packager@kde.org and release-team@kde.org, attaching REVISIONS_AND_HASHES and tags.git
 * Make sure someone acts on RELEASE_PROMOTION
 * ./create_sources_inc > ../www_info/source-kf-5.0.0.inc  then svn add + commit.
   Coordinate with the people doing web announcement for this
 * Once the release has been publicly announced run tag_all.sh
   At the moment you have to do this manually for SVN modules:
     - svn tags are in tags/KDE/4.9.0/modulename

Note:
 * Running ./pack_all.sh again will only repackage the repos that have changed
   so it should be "cheap"
