This is a quick description on how KDE SC 4.12 beta 1 packaging was done,
obviously some of the version numbers need to be replaced by the version you are packaging ;-)

 * rm -rf sources versions REVISIONS_AND_HASHES l10n
 * Update version file with the correct version number
 * Update modules.svn file with the correct svn modules and branches
 * Update modules.git file with the correct git modules and branches
 * Read RELEASE-CHECKLIST
 * Pack the sources
     ./pack_all.sh
 * If you have ssh access to ftpadmin@depot.kde.org, upload the tarballs there,
   directly into the right location (and use chmod o-rx on the directory).
   Otherwise read ftp://upload.kde.org/README for how to upload the tarballs
   in case of doubt sysadmin will kindly help you
   Note that usually the tarballs are first only available to distro packagers
   and later they are public to everyone. sysadmin knows how to do that.
 * Do not forget to tell whoever does the ftp work to update the latest symlink
 * Inform kde-packager@kde.org and release-team@kde.org, attaching REVISIONS_AND_HASHES
 * Make sure someone acts on RELEASE_PROMOTION
 * Run create_sources_inc and upload it to trunk/www/sites/www/info/source-4.11.80.inc
   Coordinate with the people doing web announcement for this
 * Once the release has been publicly announced run tag_all.sh
   At the moment you have to do this manually for SVN modules:
     - svn tags are in tags/KDE/4.9.0/modulename

Note:
 * Running ./pack_all.sh again will only repackage the repos that have changed
   so it should be "cheap"
