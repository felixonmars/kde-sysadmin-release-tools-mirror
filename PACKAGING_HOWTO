This is a quick description on how KDE SC 4.9.0 packaging was done,
obviously some of the 4.9.0 need to be replaced by the version you are packaging ;-)

 * Update modules file with the correct svn modules
 * Update versions file with the correct svn-urls
 * Update modules.git file with the correct git modules and branches
 * Update common file with correct version number
 * Check the definitions on top of docu file are correct
 * Read RELEASE-CHECKLIST
 * Create the folder for the clean sources
     rm -rf clean
     mkdir clean
 * Do a checkout of svn
     ./checkout
 * Do a checkout of git
     ./setup-git-modules.sh
 * Do an update, saving the log is important as it will be used for tagging later on
     ./update_all &> UPDATE_LOG
 * Pack the sources
     ./pack_all &> PACK_LOG
 * Read the PACK_LOG file and make sure nothing wrong happened
 * Read ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/README_UPLOAD for how to upload the tarballs
   in case of doubt sysadmin will kindly help you
   Note that usually the tarballs are first only available to distro packagers
   and later they are public to everyone. sysadmin knows how to do that
 * Inform kde-packager@kde.org and release-team@kde.org
 * Make sure someone acts on RELEASE_PROMOTION
 * Run create_sources_inc and upload it to trunk/www/sites/www/info/source-4.9.0.inc
   Coordinate with the people doing web announcement for this
 * Once the release has been publicly announced use the UPDATE_LOG contents to tag svn and git
   At the moment you have to do this manually
     - git tags are like 'v4.9.0'
     - svn tags are in tags/KDE/4.9.0/modulename


Note 1:
In case you have to retag something you do not need to pack everything again, the
suggested procedure is
 * update saving to a different log file
     ./update_all &> NEW_UPDATE_LOG
 * Find which modules changed
     diff UPDATE_LOG NEW_UPDATE_LOG
 * Pack those modules individually
     ./pack modulename
 * Update the log file
     mv NEW_UPDATE_LOG UPDATE_LOG

Note 2:
You only have to publish the l10n tarballs of the languages present in language_list
